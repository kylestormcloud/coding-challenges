# Lucky nunmbers

## The Problem:
"Write a function to find if a number is lucky or not.
If the sum of all *digits* is 0 or multiple of 9 then the number is lucky."

## The Solution:
According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a *digit* can be defined as
"one of the elements that combine to form numbers in a system other than
the decimal system.

Therefore, any number can be considered lucky as long as it is represented
in the number system whose base is not 10*, but instead 9 divided by the
number in question.

\* If your number happens to be 0.9, the base system would be 10.
