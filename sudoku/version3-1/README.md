# Sudoku Board Checker Version 3.1

### Updates from Version 3.0:

My goal in Version 3.1 is to begin creating a testing suite.

In addition, I have added a check for input size,
which confirms that the user has input a list of nine lists,
each containing nine values. This corresponds to the nine rows
in a sudoku board, each of which contains nine spaces.
